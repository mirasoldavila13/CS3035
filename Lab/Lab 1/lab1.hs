{-
Write a Haskell script with functions to compute:

The area of a circle (just estimate pi) given the length of the radius,

The square of the length of a hypotenuse of a right triangle given the other two sides

Load the script into your ghci and use them to calculate the area of a circle (you choose the radius) and the length of a hypotenuse (you choose the side lengths)

Take a screen shot of your prompt window and submit.

Submit your script here as well.
